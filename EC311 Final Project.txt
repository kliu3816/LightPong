Project: Light Pong (Light catcher) 


Description: The light zooms back and forth and the player(s) has to catch it by flipping the switch at the position of the light. Once caught, the player gains a point and the light pauses for 3 seconds then “bounces” and travels in the opposite direction than before (like pong!). If the light reaches either end the score resets to 0 (like pong!).


Ankita: Coded movement of light and how to “catch” it, helped debug.
Kevin: Implemented 7 segment and scoring, helped test and debug.
